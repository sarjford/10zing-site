        <!-- <h2>ABOUT US</h2> -->
        <p>Our name, 10ZING Digital, was inspired by Tenzing Norgay, one of the first people to summit Mt. Everest with Edmund Hillary in 1953 well before the advent of modern climbing gear or Google Maps. Neither man ever revealed who reached the peak first. Theirs was a selfless partnership sharing in the glory of their epic achievement. This is the kind of partner we strive to be at 10ZING Digital.</p>
        <p>We hope you’ll summit with us!</p>

            <h3>ALEX SEPULVEDA</h3>
            <p>I graduated with a BA and MA in linguistics from Harvard University in the late ’90s. At the time, I had no idea how applicable my major would become to the emerging field of search engine marketing.</p>
            <p>I began my career at Backcountry.com as the site’s first content manager, helping grow the company into a top online retailer of outdoor gear.</p>
            <p>This experience led me to Google where I built and managed paid search campaigns for Fortune 500 companies across virtually every industry. I finished my tenure there as a product specialist designing AdWords and Google Analytics features while serving the Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets.</p>
            <p>After a brief stint at a large digital ad agency, I launched my own consultancy, and ultimately 10ZING Digital with my co-founder, Juan.</p>

            <h3>JUAN SALAZAR</h3>
            <p>I studied psychology and economics at Columbia University with a focus on quantitative methodology that prepared me for a data-driven approach to digital strategy.</p>
            <p>I began as an analyst at a large agency, and rose to manage a team tasked with launching and optimizing ads across all channels. I then moved to the client side, overseeing online acquisition for finance, retail, fashion and travel companies with multi-million dollar budgets.</p>
            <p>My focus shifted to high-growth startups where I cultivated a deep knowledge of social platforms, primarily Facebook and Instagram, as a source of branding and acquisition.</p>
            <p>I bring this cumulative experience to 10ZING Digital where we strive to operate a different kind of agency based on transparency, honesty and true expertise.</p>
