        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p>Our name, 10ZING Digital, was inspired by Tenzing Norgay, one of the first people to summit Mt. Everest with Edmund Hillary in 1953 well before the advent of modern climbing gear or Google Maps. Neither man ever revealed who reached the peak first. Theirs was a selfless partnership sharing in the glory of their epic achievement. This is the kind of partner we strive to be at 10ZING Digital.</p>
        <p>We hope you’ll summit with us!</p>

          <h3>ALEX SEPULVEDA</h3>
          <p>When I studied linguistics at Harvard in the ’90s with the aim of becoming an academic, I had no idea how applicable my major would become to the emerging field of internet marketing. In college, I spent a lot of time thinking about how people use words and language, and do so to this day as I craft keyword optimization, search marketing and editorial strategies for our clients.</p>
          <p>I began my career in digital marketing at Backcountry.com in 2002 as the site’s first content manager, helping grow the company into a top online retailer of outdoor gear.</p>
          <p>This experience led me to Google where I built and managed paid search campaigns for Fortune 500 companies across virtually every industry. I finished my tenure there as a product specialist designing AdWords and Google Analytics features while serving the Asia-Pacific and Latin American markets.</p>
          <p>After a brief stint at a large digital ad agency, I launched my own consultancy, and ultimately 10ZING Digital with my co-founder, Juan.</p>

          <h3>JUAN SALAZAR</h3>
          <p>I’ve always been fascinated by how we process information and make decisions, in essence what makes us act. These interests drove me to study psychology and economics at Columbia University with a focus in quantitative methodology, preparing me for a structured, data-driven approach to digital strategy.</p>
          <p>I began my career as an analyst at a leading digital agency, and rose to manage a team tasked with deploying, testing and optimizing ads across all channels. I took this experience to the client side, overseeing online customer acquisition at companies in finance, retail, fashion and travel with multi-million dollar budgets.</p>
          <p>Enticed by new challenges, my focus shifted to high-growth startups where I cultivated deep knowledge of social platforms, primarily Facebook and Instagram, as a source of branding and user acquisition. I bring this cumulative experience to 10ZING Digital where we strive to operate a different kind of agency based on transparency, honesty and true expertise.</p>
